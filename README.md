# Github Users Search Tool

## Requirements

You need to create a github users search tool.
On the main page there should be an input field where you need to enter a username.
Below should be a filtered list of users.
There should be an implementation of pagination (infinite scroll).

Clicking on a row should open the user's page with additional information about him:

- avatar image,
- name,
- followers,
- following,
- company,
- email,
- blog

This project should be written using React. Using Typescript would be a plus.
We would also appreciate the use of any state management and UI libraries.
